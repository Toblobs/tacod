__Project TACOD: Training AI Captcha Over Discord__
> A mini project by @toblobs that will aim to make an AI that can recognise LED-display style numbers via answers to Captcha-style questions through Discord members. The goal is for the program to be able to identify numbers in an LED-display format.

### Project Aims
- A look into the basics of how Captcha works and building a skeleton version from the ground up.
- Testing how the training data of a robot can influence its decision making, and how effective humans are at providing training data for an AI.
- Providing an exploration into Pythonâ€™s AI libraries and reinforcement learning.
